Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn for a bank, based on features like credit score, geography, age, balance, product usage, and activity status.

🧠 Model Overview
Framework: TensorFlow & Keras
Architecture:
Input Layer: 11 neurons (for 11 features)
2 Hidden Layers: 11 neurons each with ReLU activation
Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Churn Modelling Dataset
Total Records: 10,000 customers
Features include: CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Balance, NumOfProducts, etc.
Target: Exited (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

⚙️ Preprocessing
Dropped irrelevant columns: RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname
Categorical encoding for Gender and Geography
Feature scaling using StandardScaler

📈 Training
Split: 80% train, 20% test
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Binary Crossentropy
Epochs: 100
Batch size: 50

✅ Results
Final test accuracy: ~79.75%
Training and validation loss/accuracy tracked over epochs

🧪 Evaluation
Prediction on test set using threshold-based sigmoid outputs
Accuracy calculated using sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score
